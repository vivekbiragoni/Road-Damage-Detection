### Project: TRINIT-TV-ML

#### Overview:
Automated Road Damage Detection for Infrastructure Maintenance is the focus of this project. The goal is to develop a classification model capable of automatically detecting and categorizing road damage from images. This will enhance infrastructure management by reducing reliance on manual inspections and enabling timely repairs.

#### How to Run:
1. Execute `streamlit run app.py` to launch the interface.
2. Upload any image in the interface.
3. View the results, which include the type of road damage detected (D00: Longitudinal Crack, D10: Transverse Crack, D20: Alligator Crack, D40: Pothole).
4. Alternatively, select "explore" in the sidebar to analyze the data further.

#### Model and Files:

#### Problem Description (Hackathon):
The project addresses the time-consuming and labor-intensive task of manual road inspection. The objective is to involve object detection (using YOLO or R-CNN) to capture only roads, followed by classifying the damaged roads.

#### Brownie Points:
- Deploy the model using Firebase.
- View real-time road damage alerts generated by the model.

#### Evaluation Metric:
Intersection over Union (IoU)
